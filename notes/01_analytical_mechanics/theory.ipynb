    "- To see the last point, consider a particle constrained to a surface $f(q_1,\\dots,q_N,t) = 0$. We can choose independent generalized coordinates $q_j, j=1,\\dots,N-k$ that satisfy the $k$ constraints. The Euler-Lagrange equations then provide the dynamics. Constraint forces never enter explicitly."
