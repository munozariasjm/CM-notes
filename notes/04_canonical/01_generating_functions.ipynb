    "In Lagrangian mechanics, there are ways of obatining invariance in Euler Lagrange equations by either using a point transformation, or adding a total derivative to the Lagrangian. In Hamiltonian mechanics, we can obtain invariance in Hamilton's equations by using a canonical transformation. In this notebook, we will explore the canonical transformation and its properties.\n",

    "For the Hamiltonian, we know that we can transform any point in the phase space with a function for momentum and position. This is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_i = Q_i(q, p, t) \\quad P_i = P_i(q, p, t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Q_i$ and $P_i$ are the new coordinates and $q$ and $p$ are the old coordinates. They have to (ofcourse) remain soluctions for Hamilton's equations. This means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot q = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}, \\quad \\dot p = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}$$\n",

    "Then, we propose $K$, a new Hamiltonian, such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot Q = \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial P}, \\quad \\dot P = -\\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial Q}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ofcourse they still have to meet Hamilton's principle (in addition to the traditional variables). Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\left( \\sum_i p_i \\dot q_i - H \\right) dt = 0, \\quad \\delta \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\left( \\sum_i P_i \\dot Q_i - K \\right) dt = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This variation only leaves us an option: for relating the two Hamiltonians, we must have:\n",

    "$$\\lambda (p\\dot q - H) = \\sum_i P_i \\dot Q_i - K + \\dot F$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ defines if the transformation is canonical or not. $F$ is the **generating function** of the transformation. And there are some cases for the generating function that dictate the type of transformation.\n",
